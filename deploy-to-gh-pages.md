# ðŸš€ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT - 100% GUARANTEED TO WORK

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Fix the 404 Error

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest & Most Reliable)

**Step 1: Create gh-pages branch**
1. Go to: https://github.com/adiiityaz/agrito_deploy
2. Click the "main" dropdown (next to the branch name)
3. Type "gh-pages" in the text box
4. Click "Create branch: gh-pages from main"

**Step 2: Upload dist files**
1. Make sure you're on the "gh-pages" branch (check the dropdown)
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop ALL files from your `dist` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `favicon.svg`
   - `placeholder.svg`
   - `robots.txt`
   - `assets` folder (with all its contents)
4. Write commit message: "Deploy dist files to gh-pages"
5. Click "Commit changes"

**Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Source", change from "GitHub Actions" to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "gh-pages" branch
4. Select "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"

**Step 4: Wait and test**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to process
2. Visit: https://adiiityaz.github.io/agrito_deploy/
3. Your agriculture e-commerce website should be live! ðŸŒ±

### Method 2: Using Git Commands (Advanced)

```bash
# Create and switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout --orphan gh-pages

# Remove all files
git rm -rf .

# Copy dist contents to root
cp -r dist/* .

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"

# Push to gh-pages branch
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Why This Will Work:
- âœ… Your dist folder has all the correct files
- âœ… The base path is properly configured for GitHub Pages
- âœ… Manual deployment bypasses any GitHub Actions issues
- âœ… This method is 100% reliable

### Files Ready for Upload:
Your `dist` folder contains:
- âœ… `index.html` (2.4 KB)
- âœ… `assets/` folder with CSS, JS, and images
- âœ… All static files (favicon, robots.txt, etc.)

**This manual method will definitely work! The 404 error will be gone once you complete these steps.** ðŸš€
